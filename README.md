# 1. Marble Win Probabilities
This tool predicts the probability for each marble that it will win the championship or make a podium appearance. Inputs include current standings (with points), award system (points awarded for each finishing place), and an average finisher rate. The underlying assumption is that each marble has equal probability to finish in any position in the race.
